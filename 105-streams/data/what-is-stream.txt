- Streams allows to read and write data in chunks i.e. efficiently
- As file system also implements Events
- 'data' is the event which will be fired when stream will read the data
- If the file size is more then buffer size then we have to use stream while reading files
- We should always use buffer to read/write files

- Pipes allows to take a source stream (i.e. readable stream) to a destination (i.e. writeable stream)
