# Introduction

- I am learning NodeJS from YouTube, Udemy and various other sources, and all the practice which I do, will add into this repo
- I will add all the references here, if I missed anything, please do let me know.
- For now I have the code for which I didn't saved the reference earlier, and now I am not finding the source, if anyone get to know from where this code is copied or taken, please do let me know. most probably it is from some of the YouTube playlist for NodeJS
